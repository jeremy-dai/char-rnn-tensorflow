

Look What You Made Me Do
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play of the fool
No I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool
No I don't like you ooh
But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
I got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice ooh
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast what
The world moves on another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice ooh


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

      Ready for It
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted

But if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it
Me I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
And he can be my jailer Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now now
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


No one has to know
In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it
Ooh are you ready for it
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone

I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it

  
  
  
  
  Call it what you want
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was
Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Love's me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn I never learn
At least I did one thing right I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Love's me like I'm brand new
Call it what you want call it what you want call it


So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck
Chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say
I recall late November
Holding my breath slowly I said you don't need to save me
But would you run away with me
Yes
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah call it what you want to
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want yeah call it what you want to


Dancing with Our Hands Tied
I I loved you in secret
First sight yeah we love without reason
Oh twenty-five years old
Oh how were you to know
And my my love had been frozen
Deep blue but you painted me golden
Oh and you held me close
Oh how was I to know I
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time
Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

F-Fears that the world would divide us
So baby can we dance
Oh through an avalanche
And say say that we got it
I'm a mess but I'm the mess that you 
wanted
Oh 'cause it's gravity
Oh keeping you with me
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets


Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it

Knew we had our hands tied
And I had a bad feeling

Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the east side where you at
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes look at you
Oh d**n never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it

Isn't it delicate
Third floor on the west side me and you
Handsome you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here honey I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

You must like me for me

      Dress
Out secret moments
In a crowded room
They've got no idea
About me and you
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Made your mark on me
A golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you   Ah ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ha ha ha ha
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Ha ha ha ha
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Ha ha ha ha
Inescapable,I'm not even going to try
And if I get burned at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Anyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about
All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ah ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ha ha ha ha
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dresssoyou could take it off, take it off   Ha ha ha
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Only bought this dress so you could take it off  Ha ha ha
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Flash back when you met me
Your buzz cut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times
You could see the best of me
Flash back to my mistakes
My rebounds my earthquakes
Even in my worst lighs
You saw the truth of me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only my lifeline
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake and I can't explain this
Ha ha ha ha
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off  Ha ha ha ha
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off  Ha ha ha ha
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me,golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
     End Game
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Aah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Aah, and I heard about you (yah)
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yah)
I'm a call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too, 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your end game


I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
Now well, when I was young, we connected
When we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumors are knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in a song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah, but I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team


I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's a truth from my red lips
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string (Me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game







      Getaway Car
It was the best of times the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black the lies were white
In shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin' but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car oh-oh
No they never get far oh-ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
It was the great escape the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
Well he was runnin' after us I was screamin' "go go go"
But with three of us honey it's a side show
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry we're both sorry
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin' but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car oh-oh
No they never get far oh-ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in the motel bar
I put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin' but we never get far don't pretend
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart should've known
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car oh-oh
No they never get far oh-ahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car


King of My Heart
I'm perfectly fine I live on my own
I made up my mind I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me baby like tryin' on clothes
So prove to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once I've been waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting waiting
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once
Late in the night the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping dreaming dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
So prove to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
Inside my room oh
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
Where you do
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once I've been waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting waiting
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once
Is the end of all the endings
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me not fancy stuff
Baby all at once this is enough
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once you're all I want I'll never let you go
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once I've been waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once 'cause you're the one I have been waiting waiting
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once














I Did Something Bad
I never trust a narcissist
But they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them
They tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks sh*t then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming
They say I did something bad ah
Then why's it feel so good
They say I did something bad ah
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had ah
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Death trap trap trap
I never trust a playboy
But they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin'
What I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change then he had it comin'
They say I did something bad ah
Then why's it feel so good


They say I did something bad ah
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had ah
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
It just felt so good
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Death trap trap trap
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up light me up light me up light me up
Light me up go ahead and light me up light me up
Light me up light me up light me up light me up
Light me up light me up light me up
They say I did something bad ah oh
Then why's it feel so good so good
They say I did something bad ah
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good good
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta death trap
Oh you say I did something bad ah
Then why's it feel so good good
So bad why's it feel so good
Why's it feel why's it feel so good bad
It just felt so good good


    So It Goes...
See you in the dark
All eyes on you my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin' trip-trippin' when you're gone
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone it's so simple
'Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it
And all our pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in the moments
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin' skip-skippin' when I'm gone
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone it's so simple
'Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it
And all our pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in the moments
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes
Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes
You did a number on me
But honestly baby who's counting
I did a number on you
But honestly baby who's counting
You did a number on me
But honestly baby who's counting
Who's counting
1 2 3
And all our pieces fall pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in the moments caught up caught up
Lipstick on your face
So it goes goes
I'm yours to keep oh
And I'm yours to lose baby
You know I'm not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes
Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes
Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes









    New Year's Day
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby


Candle wax and Polaroids on the 

hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere



















This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jumping to the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champaign sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So why'd you have to rain on my parade
I'm shaking my head
I'm locking the gates
This is why we can't have nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren'tso shady
This is why we can't have nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have
Here's a toast to my real friend
They don't care about that he said she said

And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha I can't even say it with a straight face
This is why we can't have nice things darling darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things darling
And here's to my real friends
Because you break them
I had to take them
And here's to my baby
Nice things darling
He didn't care about that he said she said
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things
